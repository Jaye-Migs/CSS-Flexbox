This is a documentation of my CSS Flexbox.
i copied the last CSS Grid Files into a new repository
for the flexbox, i made a new css file and added the <'style'> that im going to use so i dont make the individual files cluttered
i used the <'link rel'> so the browser understand how to interact with the linked resource, optimizing the loading of styles, icons, or other important documents for the webpage.
then i used <'href'> to call on the flexbox.css file and apply its contents on the documents
